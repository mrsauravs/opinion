When a state is constantly under one rule, a lot of misconceptions do arise. 
While spending some time in Belarus, I realized quite a few things regarding the mainstream news media and their fellow YouTubers that most of the rumors are indeed lies. 
There are rules in this country but the most absurd rumors that you can come across is about the state spying on its citizens and KGB following foreigners. 
There’s no ban on VPN nor a ban on cryptocurrency. 
They are regulated instead. 
You can’t perform criminal activities through either crypto or VPN which is a simple law that exists in any other country.

As an Indian citizen, I already know how spying works in a democracy, especially through Aadhaar and phone number tracking. 
In terms of Belarus, this absurd feature is non-existent. 
Instead, they have a national ID which is available on their passports along with the passport serial numbers that allows them to do a quick verification if required. 
Its redundant form does exist in India if you’re open to sharing your tracking data to each and every private and public department on countless occasions but you still won’t get the work done. 
The irony is that the data you share with these departments is finally sold to the advertising markets to target you in return. 
Maybe, this is the ultimate service that you can dream of in the world’s largest democracy.

The main issue that I wanted to highlight is that financial freedom is something that every citizen dreams of in a democracy such as India. 
And, when they are fooled at each and every step in the name of patriotism is something that all of us need to ponder upon and maybe get a little agitated too. 
The middle income group in India pays the high taxes and yet suffers the most. 
This statement is strongly opposed by the government and their stooges based on the data that reveals that the middle class and middle income group fall in the category of 6,00,000 INR to 15,00,000 INR. 
Ironically, this is an outdated number that the government banks on. 
The middle income group has widened quite a lot in recent years and the income now falls just under 50,00,000 INR. 
So, there ought to be a new division  in the tax slab that covers it well. 
Unfortunately, people who waited to see that in this Union Budget couldn’t even see this coming in the near future.
The story of cryptocurrency is at another level. 
Though the Indian government claims that it is regulated, it is at its best close to being banned only. 
You can neither create a wallet other than in INR nor you can use your bank cards to recharge any of them in case you have them. 
Financial freedom is a myth in India and maybe in most democracies too.

To top that, the pathetic state of infrastructure in India and the growing decline in public health is too interlinked. 
The catch is that the more you keep an area under constant construction, the more you drive the economy but at the same time you put your citizen’s health at risk. 
The problem is not with the construction but in its completion time and poor state that it is often left to. 
While I haven’t seen any proper construction in India, it is ironic to even think of its completion time. 
The forever time of endless construction of metro rail lines in Bengaluru and Pune is beyond my understanding and imagination. 
It is either you do or you stop and let people live.

The condition of roads are in a similar state. 
They are never ready by any municipality and they make you feel that they are working tirelessly only for you by digging holes everywhere. 
I am not even accounting for the sorry state of medical care in India as it is non-existent and is only available for those who invest with the private players. 
So, in total, as an Indian citizen, you additionally invest in a good supply of air, water, food, medicines, and infrastructure in case you find a privately built up society in the middle of nowhere or on top of a natural resource. 
Otherwise, you can forget about these necessities as they are deemed luxury in India. 
All this when you see and live with, makes you agitated to the least and furious to even think of paying either direct or indirect taxes.

And, when I compare that to a country that was rebuilt from scratch after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 90s makes me feel more ashamed of being an Indian. 
And mind you, it’s the frustration and not the lack of patriotism.
