When a state is constantly under one rule, a lot of misconceptions do arise. 
While spending some time in Belarus, I realized quite a few things regarding the mainstream news media and their fellow YouTubers that most of the news about Belarus are indeed lies and rumors. 

You might have heard rumors that the state is spying on its citizens or the KGB is following foreigners. 
These are all baseless rumors that create fear mongering to spread hate about a country.
There’s no ban on VPN or cryptocurrency. 
They are regulated instead meaning that you can’t perform criminal activities through either crypto or VPN which coincides with a simple law that exists in any other country. If you think a VPN gives you a certain level of privacy from the government agencies, you better get accustomed to NSA’s doing in the US. We are all tracked everywhere in the world.
Despite bearing the heavy load of western sanctions, there are no restrictions on living and in fact you can enjoy more freedom than in any other country.
There are indeed rules in Belarus but they are designed for a smooth living and are not intended for any torture or grip on residents.

India on the other hand is a different story.
Though there are no western sanctions on India, its governance imposes some of the heaviest sanctions on its residents.
The sorry state of affairs is that Indian citizens are fooled at each and every step in the name of patriotism and that is something that all of us need to ponder upon and maybe get a little agitated too. 

The congress government in India started the Aadhaar scheme in the name of giving the social security number to Indian citizens.
But due to backlash, it was kept on the back burner.
However, when the other government came to power, it quickly restarted the process.
Despite having a PAN (or permanent account number), citizens were forced to create Aadhaar numbers for social security.
The logic given to us was that the duplicate PAN numbers exist and Aadhaar will solve that discrepancy. 
The irony is that you can resolve duplicates by enforcing re-registration or re-verification of PAN. But the larger question is that did you get your social security?

In Belarus, its citizens have national IDs and they are available on their passports along with the passport serial numbers. 
This allows them to do a quick verification if required.
You must know that the mere intention of creating the Aadhaar system in India was tracking its citizens.
And, this is done in every democracy of the world.
The irony is that the Aadhaar system was reduced to being only a marketing gimmick and I mean it in literal sense.
The data you share with these departments is finally sold to the advertising markets to target you in return. 
Maybe, this was the ultimate service that you are allowed to dream of in the world’s largest democracy.
 
The financial freedom in India is a misnomer too.
You can't open a USD or EURO bank account. 
You cannot exchange USD or EURO as citizens without a visa for abroad. 
The story of cryptocurrency is at another level. 
Though the Indian government claims that it is regulated, it is at its best close to being banned only. 
You can neither create a wallet other than in INR nor you can use your bank cards to recharge any of them in case you have them. 

The middle income group in India pays the highest taxes and yet suffers the most. 
This statement is strongly opposed by the government and their stooges in the media because the middle class and middle income group fall in the category of 6,00,000 INR to 15,00,000 INR. 
Ironically, this is an outdated number that the government banks on. 
The middle income group has widened quite a lot in recent years and the income now falls just under 50,00,000 INR. 
So, there ought to be a new division in the tax slab that covers it well. 
Unfortunately, people who waited to see the 2024 Union Budget couldn’t even see this coming in the near future.

To top that, the pathetic state of infrastructure in India and the growing decline in public health are often ignored as if they don’t mean anything.
Your well being is not the responsibility of the state but only yours.
And for that you have to pay the ransom in the name of taxes.

To fool you in the illusion of continuous development, you are surrounded by constant construction nearby.
The problem is not with the construction but in its completion time and poor state that it is often left to.
The condition of roads are in a similar state. 
They are never ready by any municipality and they make you feel that they are working tirelessly only for you by digging holes everywhere. 
The forever time of endless construction of metro rail lines in Bengaluru and Pune is beyond my understanding and imagination. 
It is either you do or you stop and let people live.
But as your well being and health is your sole responsibility, you have to deal with that.

I am not even accounting for the sorry state of medical care in India as it is non-existent and is only available for those who invest with the private players. 
So, in total, as an Indian citizen, you additionally invest in a good supply of air, water, food, medicines, and infrastructure in case you find a privately built up society in the middle of nowhere or on top of a natural resource. 
Otherwise, you can forget about these necessities as they are deemed luxury in India. 
All this when you see and live with, makes you agitated to the least and furious to even think of paying either direct or indirect taxes.

And, when I compare that to a country that was rebuilt from scratch after the fall of the Soviet Union in the 90s makes me feel more ashamed of being an Indian. 
And mind you, it’s the frustration and not the lack of patriotism.
