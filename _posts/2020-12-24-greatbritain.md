If you have watched Rick Steves Europe, you might be flabbergasted or lost to the beauty of Europe. There’s indeed a great deal of charm in the european countries. The United Kingdom on the other hand is a bit different. Though it is still a well maintained or managed country, it’s glory in the last few decades has deteriorated immensely due to the sudden ingestion of immigrants. In a way it is justified because the United Kingdom that we know of today has a long history of bullying independent countries and annexing them to their territory. Their greatness began sometime in 1707 when they added the Kingdom of Scotland and Wales to their territory. In 1801, the Republic of Ireland joined it and then left the Greatness forgetting about their northern territory. The remainder of that Great alliance is what is called the United Kingdom. However, the cunning brits have chosen to reserve the name “Great” for being the largest island in the British Isles.

Migration and resettlement have always been painful for the people. The intelligence alliance FVEY (Five Eyes) that comprises of the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand constantly keeps a watch on the movement of people. The visa process has also been made stringent over the years for these allied countries. The European Union doesn't come under this and so they have their own stringent rules for the migrants but still EU has the policy of accomodating citizens of the war-hit nations as asylum seekers. To top that, EU also accepts international students which eventually leads to the settlement of some of the undesired migrants coming from that route. The UK being part of the EU also has to accommodate a great deal of that population. In addition to this, Brits have also comprehended that the countries Great Britain have destroyed in the past are also pushing migrants to enter their godforsaken sovereign state. True or not? At least that’s what the brits think. You can’t argue a brit. The increasing crime rates on the streets of London and Birmingham are a clear indication that the United Kingdom has been giving easy migration to the nincompoops from around the world. Owing to all this nonsense, the not so Great Britain has chosen to leave the European Union.

Brexit will not only benefit UK but also that intelligence alliance, FVEY. The new US President, Joe Biden, is also keen to keep a tab on the UK. The US also wants that the UK should strike a trade deal with EU before the official Brexit i.e. 1st January 2021. The recent development suggests that the cunning Brits have indeed struck a good deal with EU. There have been some differences between the two if you are following the border closing drama amidst the new SARS-CoV-2 viral strain. But these are things of the past, and the UK has comeout of it. Boris Johnson can now save his political chair for sometime. With all this, the only thing that the UK now needs to be careful with is the insurgence of international students especially from the Indian subcontinent. The UK has already been clever on this. If you look at the recent September 2020 and January 2021 admissions, you'll notice how the UK opens its admission session and then choses to close their borders closer to the course start date. In a way, they want the hefty amount of money that they charge to the international students but would prefer to keep those international students away from their territory for as long as possible. They also have an unofficial mandate to limit the number of student visas. Their justification is SARS-CoV-2 but if the brits were afraid of the SARS-CoV-2, they wouldn’t have proposed the idea of herd immunity in the first place. To top that, they are also running the business of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The grave side effects of the Pfizer BioNTech vaccine will surely benefit the UK when they will rollout the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. And if you feel that the greatness of the United Kingdom should die its natural death, you'd be proven wrong as FVEY and NATO alliance is too strong to bring down its greatness. The efforts that the Indian Prime Minister, Mr. Modi, has made to the UK will be futile as a trade deal between India and UK will not benefit the UK much. This could have been useful if there would be no trade deal between EU and the UK. This Stockholm syndrome is actually dangerous for India. Any attempts to please the two giants of NATO is futile and yeild no benefits to a country like India. Pakistan on the other hand could get through, being the closest threat to India.
