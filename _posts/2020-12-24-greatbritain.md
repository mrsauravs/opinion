If you have watched Rick Steves Europe, you might be flabbergasted or lost to the beauty of Europe. There’s indeed a great deal of charm in the european countries. The United Kingdom on the other hand is a bit different. Though it is still a well maintained or managed country, it’s glory in the last few decades has deteriorated immensely due to the sudden ingestion of immigrants. In a way it is justified because the United Kingdom that we know of today has a long history of bullying independent countries and annexing them to their territory. Their greatness began sometime in 1707 when they added the Kingdom of Scotland and Wales to their territory. In 1801, the Republic of Ireland joined it and then left the Greatness forgetting about their northern territory. The remainder of that Great alliance is what is called the United Kingdom. However, the cunning brits have chosen to reserve the name “Great” for being the largest island in the British Isles.

Instead of redeveloping the war-hit nations, European Union has this policy to provide asylum to the people whose homes have been destroyed by the NATO armed forces (oops, it’s always the Russian armed forces if you believe the media). The UK being part of the EU also has to accommodate a great deal of that population. In addition to this, Brits have also comprehended that the countries Great Britain have destroyed in the past are also pushing migrants to enter their godforsaken sovereign state. True or not? At least that’s what the brits think. You can’t argue a brit. The increasing crime rates on the streets of London and Birmingham are a clear indication that the United Kingdom has been giving easy migration to the nincompoops from around the world. Owing to all this nonsense, the not so Great Britain has chosen to leave the European Union.

In the recent and ongoing pandemic, the EU has chosen to close its borders at least to the international students. They are clear on that. The UK on the other hand wants to play both sides. They want the hefty amount of money that they charge to the international students but still want those international students to be away from their territory. In the year 2020, the way they are doing is that they are opening their admissions but unofficially limiting the number of visas and later closing their borders as and when required. The September and January admission sessions are examples of it. If the brits were afraid of the SARS-CoV-2, they wouldn’t have proposed the idea of herd immunity in the first place. To top that, they are also running to the business of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The cunning Brits always knew that leaving the EU would yield a no-trade deal hence their inherit unfair means of earning is the only way out. The EU wants to punish the UK and the rest of the world should follow the suit instead of pleasing them.

Owing to the current situation with the UK, Indian Prime Minister, Mr. Modi, wants to strike a trade deal with the not so Great Britain. He even invited Mr. Johnson to the republic day celebrations. For clarity, people should understand that whatever differences the EU and the UK have, the UK will still be the second largest NATO member. The large part of the world still listens to the two greats, US and UK. India, a non NATO member nation could never get through them. Pakistan on the other hand could, being the closest threat to India. Contrary to this fact, the Indian Prime Ministers or the political diaspora constantly tries to please NATO. To me it looks like a futile effort, but India is something that I would take a century more to understand. I’m not Modi but if I were, I would have left Britain to die its natural death.
